## Ingredients

- 1 cup couscous
- 1 ¼ cups vegetable broth
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 cucumber, diced
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
- ¼ cup red onion, finely chopped
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped
- ¼ cup fresh mint, chopped
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground coriander
- ½ teaspoon paprika
- ¼ teaspoon cinnamon
- Salt and pepper to taste
- ¼ cup crumbled feta cheese (optional)
- Optional protein: Grilled chicken or chickpeas

## Instructions

1. In a medium saucepan, bring the vegetable broth to a boil. Remove from heat and add the couscous. Stir and cover the saucepan with a lid. Let it sit for 5 minutes until the couscous absorbs the liquid.
2. Fluff the couscous with a fork, breaking up any clumps. Drizzle olive oil over the couscous and sprinkle with ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Mix well to evenly distribute the spices.
3. In a large bowl, combine the red bell pepper, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, parsley, and mint.
4. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. Pour the dressing over the vegetable mixture and toss well.
5. Add the seasoned couscous to the bowl of vegetables and mix until everything is well combined.
6. Optional: If desired, add grilled chicken or chickpeas to the salad for added protein.
7. Serve the Moroccan Couscous Salad chilled or at room temperature. Sprinkle with crumbled feta cheese on top, if desired.

Enjoy the burst of flavors in this refreshing and vibrant Couscous Salad!
