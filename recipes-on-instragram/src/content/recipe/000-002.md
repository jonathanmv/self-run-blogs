## Instructions

1. Rinse the quinoa under cold water to remove any bitter coating. In a saucepan, bring the vegetable broth or water to a boil. Add the quinoa, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed and the quinoa is tender. Remove from heat and let it cool.
2. While the quinoa is cooking, prepare the grilled tofu. In a shallow dish, whisk together soy sauce or tamari, maple syrup or honey, lemon juice, olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cut the tofu into slices or cubes, place them in the marinade, and let them marinate for at least 10 minutes.
3. Preheat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Remove the tofu from the marinade and grill for about 2-3 minutes per side or until nicely charred and heated through. Remove from the grill and let it cool slightly. Cut the grilled tofu into bite-sized pieces.
4. In a large bowl, combine the cooked quinoa, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red bell pepper, red onion, Kalamata olives, parsley, mint, and grilled tofu.
5. In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, extra virgin olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Pour the dressing over the quinoa salad and toss to combine.
6. Taste and adjust the seasonings if needed. If desired, top the salad with crumbled feta cheese and toasted pine nuts for an extra flavor boost.

Serve the Mediterranean Quinoa Salad with Grilled Tofu as a fulfilling and protein-rich lunch option. It's packed with nutritious ingredients and bursting with flavors.
